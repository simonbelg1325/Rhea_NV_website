At Rhea we re-develop these applications in the same way as they are currently used, but with a complete fresh backbone. This means your business applications will cost much less to maintain, be secure, protected from data loss, quiker and easier to use, open to potentially interconnect with other systems (like a CRM or other open applications) and future proof.',
